# hello-world
Where my ideas, first projects, and notes will be stored.

I'm an aspiring developer ready to learn and eager to execute. Amongst other things I've purchased a ton of Udemy courses, enrolled in freecodecamp.com and hope that my tech buds will help guide me through this process. May the force be with us all.
